we're introducing a new player to dnd, and, as you know, a new character sheet that's chock full of mumbo-jumbo can be _very_ intimidating. <p><p>
To solve that, I decided Nutshell would be my best option - a drop-down program of infinite value. <p>
Initially, this _might_ just be a webpage with all of our player's abilities, features, and spells. However, it would be _great_ if I could also integrate it all into a regular Character sheet. Though, considering the limitiations that that might impose, i'm not sure that it would be possible to carry through.<p>
Yeah, actually. This is going to just be a well-organized data repository, nothing special. Doesn't need to be.
